Macleay Island is a small island off the coast of Redland Bay.

There are no major tourist attractions, although it's a fantastic area to take a day trip and explore. Most of the roads are designated as cycle friendly, and there is an off-road cycleway that runs most of the length of the island, so it's a great place to get around by bike.

There is a rather steep hill to climb to get out of the ferry terminal, but don't let that discourage you; most of the island is flat and quite easy to cycle.

<h3>Facilities</h3>
The island is highly cycle friendly, and most destinations have racks to lock up your bike. Water is a scarce commodity however, so you will need to bring a few bottles yourself or be prepared to pay for it.

Somewhat surprisingly for a cycle destination there doesn't seem to be any bicycle rental or repair services, so bring a spare tube if you're planning on heading off-road.

There's a number of supermarkets including Foodworks and Spar.

<h3>Dining on Macleay Island<br></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/blueparrotcafemacleayisland/">Blue Parrot Cafe</a></em> is a classy licensed restaurant not a hundred metres from the ferry terminal. Serving both traditional and exotic cuisines the Blue Parrot is a great place to dine, and their air conditioned balcony overlooking the bushland is fantastic.</li>
<li><em>Pub Paradise</em> is across the road from the Blue Parrot and while it's decidedly less classy than the Blue Parrot, they do offer a number of seafood options if that's more your scene.</li>
<li>There's a seafood take away store <em>Just Seafood</em> on the Northern end of the island opposite Noogie Street, near the Bendigo Bank.</li>
<li>Furthermore, there are a number of options opposite Florence Street including Dario's Gourmet Pizzeria and Le Bon Bakery &amp; Patisserie.</li>

<h3>Getting to Macleay Island</h3>
<a href="https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/stops/macleay-island">Passenger services to the island</a> generally run every half hour from Redland Bay, and there's also a car ferry if you're planning on taking your vehicle. A return passenger ticket will cost just shy of $15.00.
