Bribie Island is a large sand island about twenty kilometres east of Caboolture, and is connected to the mainland via a vehicle and pedestrian bridge.

Bribie Island serves as the northern-most endpoint for the <a href="../moreton-bay-cycleway/">Moreton Bay Cycleway</a>, but very few bicycle facilities have yet been constructed between the island and Deception Bay so it's not advised to cycle this route unless you're a confident road cyclist.

<h3>Bikes on Bribie Island</h3>
Bribie Island itself is a great cycle destination for the novice and expert alike. There's an extensive cycle network along the eastern side of the island, a comprehensive residential cycle network on the mainland between Sandstone Point and Ningi, and a cycle track most of the way between the bridge to the mainland and the suburb of Woorim on the eastern side of the island.

There are also <em>bicycle hire</em> facilities available from the plaza area to the south of the bridge at Bongaree.

<h3>Cycle Destinations on Bribie Island</h3>
There's two main cycle destinations on Bribie Island; <em>Bongaree</em>, and <em>Woorim.</em>

Bongaree is on the western side of the island, about three kilometres south from the bridge. There main attraction is the park and dining culture. There's everything from take-away fish &amp; chips to cafes, to pub meals. It's a great place to have lunch and unwind after a ride.

Woorim has the surf beach, and as such has more of a beach culture. There's a pub and a few take-away stores, but the main attraction is the water which is a great day trip destination.

<h3>Bribie Island Bridge</h3>
The bridge to Bribie Island is the only let-down, as it was originally built in 1963 and is in desperate need of an upgrade. The cycleway on either end narrows into a footway across the bridge, with bays to allow for passing. There is not enough room to even walk two abreast, and the railing is particularly nasty for getting your handlebars caught in. You'll need to pay attention when you're crossing, otherwise you may end up in a bit of a tangle.

Bribie Island is a booming suburban area, although replacing the aging bridge is a low priority. The Queensland Government has proposed the construction of a desalinisation plant on the island however, which should it be approved would require the bridge to be upgraded or re-built.

As a part of the Moreton Bay Cycleway project, this project would likely involve upgraded cycling facilities across Pumicestone Passage to replace the existing pedestrian lane. No plans have yet been confirmed.
