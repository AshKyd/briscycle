The Bicentennial Bikeway is a popular Brisbane cycleway running past the Brisbane CBD and helping connect Toowong and the western suburbs.

The bikeway has a number of entrances from the <a href="../goodwill-bridge/">Goodwill Bridge</a> to Toowong, and is a great way to explore the city.

<h4>Getting to and from the city by bike</h4>
The bikeway starts at the foot of the <a href="../goodwill-bridge/">Goodwill Bridge</a>, where you have access to South Bank and the Botanic Gardens. Further along you have access to Queen Street, Ann Street, and Herschel Street.

There is an onramp leading to Queen Street at the landing of the Victoria Bridge which is the main access to the Queen Street Mall, and bike parking is available in the square by the library.

The ramp leading to Herschel street leads to a set of lights to get you across the road, and you can continue around the block to get to the Kurilpa Bridge.

While there is a ramp leading to Turbot and Ann Street, it leads to a very busy road with little in the way of pedestrian or cycle infrastructure. If you're heading to the city it's probably better to take the Queen or Herschel Street exits instead.

<h4>Cycling Along Coronation Drive</h4>
You can use the Go Between Bridge to get access to South Bank and beyond. If you're looking for a bridge adventure you can cross this bridge and loop back around to get to the Kurilpa Bridge.

Other exits include:

<ol><li>Cribb Street/Little Cribb Street: Two exits, one ramp to Coronation drive, and one underpass that takes you around the back away from the traffic.</li>
<li>Graham Street/Park Road: A ramp that takes you to the intersection of Graham Street and Coronation drive. There are pedestrian lights to help you cross, and Park Road is a short ride from away.</li>
<li>Lang Parade: A ramp leading to the intersection of Lang Parade and coronation drive which will take you through to Auchenflower train station.</li>
<li>Land Street/Western Suburbs: If you're heading to the Western Suburbs, taken the Land Street underpass, and then follow Sylvan Road until you reach the the Western Freeway Bikeway.</li>
</ol><h4>Riding to and from Toowong</h4>
At the Toowong end of the Bicentennial Bikeway, the path merges with the footpath and travels alongside Coronation Drive. From here you have bike access to Sylvan Road, as well as Toowong Village including the retail and dining nearby.

After Toowong, there is bike infrastructure and routes that lead to St Lucia and the University of Queensland, as well as through to Taringa.

<h3>Riding to the western suburbs</h3>
If you're interested in heading further south or west, check out the <a href="../western-freeway-bikeway/">Western Freeway</a> page for maps and information.

<h3>Things to Do</h3>
There's a few <a href="../bike-hire-in-brisbane/">CityCycle stations</a> in the area, so this bikeway is a great way of sightseeing around the city. Take a day trip along the river, and see all the sights by pedal power.

If you're looking for restaurants, stop off at Park Road road in Milton or there are several food options in Toowong.
