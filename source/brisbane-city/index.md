There are a number of inner-city roads with cycle lanes as well as key arterial cycle links to get from the suburbs into the city. These include the Bicentennial Bikeway, the South East Freeway Bikeway, and the Normanby Cycleway Link.

Recreational cycling is a great way to explore Brisbane City. There is plenty to see along the Bicentennial Bikeway which follows the Brisbane River from Toowong to New Farm. There is also convenient access to South Bank via the Kurilpa and Goodwill bridges, and plenty of bike parking at the top of Queen Street Mall.

There are a number of Brisbane City cycling initiatives including the construction of the <a href="../cycle-centres/">cycle centres</a> and the Brisbane City Council <a href="../cycle-centres/#http:/www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/BCC:BASE::pc=PC_5516">CityCycle</a> initiative which will see 2000 bikes available for hire at key locations around the city.
