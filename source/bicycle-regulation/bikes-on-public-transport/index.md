Bikes are permitted on some forms of public transport in Brisbane.

<h3>Bike on Trains</h3>
Bikes are not permitted on trains during peak times (although you may take your bike in the opposite direction of peak traffic.)

Weekends, public holidays and early mornings are generally safe to travel on the train, although if the carriage becomes full you may be asked to alight to make room for passengers.

Translink states the following times are no-go times times:

<ul>
	<li>7am - 9:30am towards the CBD</li>
	<li>3pm - 6:30pm outwards from the CBD</li>
</ul>

You can generally lock your bike at the train station, and many suburban stations have secure bike lockers for extra protection. For more info see the Translink <a href="https://translink.com.au/travel-with-us/cycling-and-walking">bike locker info.</a>

<h3>Bikes on Ferries</h3>
Bikes are permitted any time on Brisbane ferries, but this is dependent on capacity. Try to avoid peak times because ferries will tend to fill up with commuters.

Passenger ferries in the Redlands Bay area generally allow bicycles (particularly to Lamb Island, Macleay Island, and Coochiemudlo Island.)

<h3>Bikes on Buses</h3>
Brisbane city does not provide any bicycle facilities on buses, so unless you have a foldable bike you can't take it on the bus. There was a trial of bike racks on buses started in 2002, but there are no longer any buses with racks available.

If you're unfortunate enough to be catching a rail replacement bus, these will have a luggage area you can stash your bike.

Cycling in bus lanes and transit lanes is allowed which can be helpful in the CBD, but you can't cycle along actual dedicated busways.
