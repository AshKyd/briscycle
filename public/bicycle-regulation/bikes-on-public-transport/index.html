    <p>Bikes are permitted on some forms of public transport in Brisbane.</p>
<h3>Bike on Trains</h3>
Bikes are not permitted on trains during peak times (although you may take your bike in the opposite direction of peak traffic.)

<p>You’re allowed to travel on weekends &amp; public holidays and early mornings on the train, although if the carriage becomes full you may be asked to get off to make room for passengers.</p>
<p>Translink states the following times are no-go times times:</p>
<ul>
    <li>7am - 9:30am towards the CBD</li>
    <li>3pm - 6:30pm outwards from the CBD</li>
</ul>

<h3>Commuting by bike on public transport</h3>
Most stations have parking rails, and some have bicycle lockers you can rent, although these are often in high demand.

<p>If you’re commuting, a folding bike may be an option as these are accepted at all times.</p>
<p>For more info see the Translink <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://translink.com.au/travel-with-us/cycling-and-walking">bike locker info.</a></p>
<h3>Bikes on Ferries</h3>
Bikes are allowed any time on CityCats, but this is dependent on capacity.

<p>Some CityCats have dedicated areas to store your bike, but not all. Try to avoid peak times because ferries will tend to fill up and you may be asked to leave.</p>
<p>Bikes can be carried onto all vehicle barges to the Southern Moreton Bay Islands, Coochiemudlo Island and North Stradbroke Island. You can take bikes on some passenger ferry services subject to space availability but it’s best to check with the individual operators before setting out.</p>
<h3>Bikes on Buses</h3>
Brisbane city does not provide any bicycle facilities on buses, so unless you have a foldable bike you can't take it on the bus.

<p>If you’re unfortunate enough to be catching a rail replacement bus, these will have a luggage area you can stash your bike.</p>
<p>Cycling in bus lanes and transit lanes is allowed which can be helpful in the CBD, but you can’t cycle along actual dedicated busways.</p>
<p>There was a brief trial of bike racks on buses way back in in 2002, but that never went anywhere. MAybe talk to your local councillor.</p>

    <h2>About Briscycle</h2>
    <p><strong>Briscycle is a passion project by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ash.ms/">Ash Kyd</a>. It originated back in 2009 when there was little or no information about (let alone cycling infrastructure) in Brisbane.</strong></p>
    <p>Today there are a bunch of resources, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cyclingbrisbane.com.au/">Brisbane Council's cycling website</a>, so this is aiming to be a bit more of a general resource.</p>
    <p>The source code to this site is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/AshKyd/briscycle">available on github</a> which means with a little technical skill you can help update the site as well! But if you just have a question or comment, please feel free to get in touch by email.</p>
