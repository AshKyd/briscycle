    <p>The Goodwill bridge is a pedestrian and cycle structure connecting the QUT Gardens Point campus and the southernmost part of the CBD with South Bank and the South East Bikeway.</p>
<p>The bridge was built in 2001 and was the first of a succession of non-motor bridges to be built in the area. Other bridges include the Kurilpa Bridge less than 2 km to the north, and the Eleanor Schonell Bridge further up the river.</p>
<p>Like the Kurilpa Bridge, the Goodwill Bridge includes several seating bays, which provide a great spot to stop and admire the view. The Goodwill Bridge has the added benefit of having the Cafe on the Bridge, a coffee cart which serves coffee, tea and desserts all week round.</p>
<h3 id="Getting-to-the-Goodwill-Bridge"><a href="#Getting-to-the-Goodwill-Bridge" class="headerlink" title="Getting to the Goodwill Bridge"></a>Getting to the Goodwill Bridge</h3><p>The Goodwill Bridge is accessible from all sides and is a great way to get to and from the city. The bikeway follows the river on both sides so it’s pretty difficult to miss it.</p>
<p>The northern landing takes you to Gardens Point where you can continue on to the QUT Gardens Point campus, turn right through the Botanic Gardens and on to the <a href="/brisbane-city/riverwalk">Riverwalk</a>, or left onto the <a href="/brisbane-city/bicentennial-bikeway">Bicentennial Bikeway</a> to Toowong.</p>
<p>The southern end lands at South Bank where you can stop at the pub, or continue left or right along the river. To get to the <a href="/brisbane-city/southeast-freeway-bikeway">Southeast Bikeway</a> and southern suburbs, turn left and follow the water until you see the M1 Motorway overhead.</p>
<h3 id="Interesting-Things-Nearby"><a href="#Interesting-Things-Nearby" class="headerlink" title="Interesting Things Nearby"></a>Interesting Things Nearby</h3><p>There’s plenty of dining nearby, including the Ship Inn pub at the southern end, and South Bank beyond. Alternatively you might want to stop at the top and grab a coffee while you admire the view.</p>
<p>The Queensland Maritime Museum is also at the southern foot of the bridge. The museum has a show of models and vessels including the Diamantina, a World War 2 navy frigate which you can explore top to bottom.</p>
<p>Or if you’re feeling like a picnic or barbecue lunch, there are plenty of spots around South Bank and the Kangaroo Point Cliffs.</p>

    <h2>About Briscycle</h2>
    <p><strong>Briscycle is a passion project by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ash.ms/">Ash Kyd</a>. It originated back in 2009 when there was little or no information about (let alone cycling infrastructure) in Brisbane.</strong></p>
    <p>Today there are a bunch of resources, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cyclingbrisbane.com.au/">Brisbane Council's cycling website</a>, so this is aiming to be a bit more of a general resource.</p>
    <p>The source code to this site is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/AshKyd/briscycle">available on github</a> which means with a little technical skill you can help update the site as well! But if you just have a question or comment, please feel free to get in touch by email.</p>
