Bikes are permitted on some forms of public transport in Brisbane.

<h3>Bike on Trains</h3>
<strike>Bikes are not permitted on trains during peak times</strike>
Apparently they revised the rules over COVID?
You can take your bike on Brisbane trains at any time.

When travelling with a bike or e-scooter during peak times, you need to:

<ul>
<li>board using the first or last carriages of six-car trains only</li>
<li>ensure only two people with bikes or e-scooters are in the first or last carriage at any time, or wait for another train</li>
<li>keep clear of access to priority seating</li>
<li>keep your bike or e-scooter clear of aisles and doorways</li>
<li>stay with your bike or e-scooter at all times.</li>
<li>If there is not enough space available, you may be asked to catch another service. Please follow the direction of staff.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Commuting by bike on public transport</h3>
Most stations have parking rails, and some have bicycle lockers you can rent, although these are often in high demand.

If you're commuting, a folding bike may be an option as these are accepted at all times.

For more info see the Translink <a href="https://translink.com.au/travel-with-us/cycling-and-walking">bike locker info.</a>

<h3>Bikes on Ferries</h3>
Bikes are allowed any time on CityCats, but this is dependent on capacity.

Some CityCats have dedicated areas to store your bike, but not all. Try to avoid peak times because ferries will tend to fill up and you may be asked to leave.

Bikes can be carried onto all vehicle barges to the Southern Moreton Bay Islands, Coochiemudlo Island and North Stradbroke Island. You can take bikes on some passenger ferry services subject to space availability but it's best to check with the individual operators before setting out.

<h3>Bikes on Buses</h3>
Brisbane city does not provide any bicycle facilities on buses, so unless you have a foldable bike you can't take it on the bus.

If you're unfortunate enough to be catching a rail replacement bus, these will have a luggage area you can stash your bike.

Cycling in bus lanes and transit lanes is allowed which can be helpful in the CBD, but you can't cycle along actual dedicated busways.

There was a brief trial of bike racks on buses way back in in 2002, but that never went anywhere. MAybe talk to your local councillor.
