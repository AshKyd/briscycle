One of the better ways to explore a new city is by bike, because you can take as much time as you like, stop wherever something catches your eye, and get a real perspective of life in Brisbane.

Brisbane is a great city for cycling because the city centre is ringed with bike paths, and there are two dockless bike share schemes in the city.

## Bike share (and scooters too!)

Before heading out, you should download and sign up to both [Neuron](https://www.rideneuron.com/) and [Beam](https://www.ridebeam.com/).

Subscription is free, and you can see a map of all the hire bikes and scooters in your area.

## Wear a helmet

Australian law requires you wear a helmet at all times while you ride a bicycle. This is strictly enforced and the fines are quite steep, so don't risk it.

There are usually helmets provided on the bikes, although occasionally it may be damaged or missing.

There will usually be another bike nearby with a helmet, so check around. You can also buy a cheap helmet for under $20 from department stores in an emergency.

Check out more [rules on riding bikes](/bicycle-regulation).

## CityCycle

CityCycle was the old bike hire scheme, which opened in 2010 and was retired in 2021.

If you're interested in a little look back through memory lane, check my [CityCycle history and eulogy](https://ash.ms/2022/01/30/brisbane-citycycle/) (off site).
