The KP green bridge will connect Kangaroo Point with the CBD at the north end of the city botanical gardens with dedicated cycle lanes. The bridge is closed to motor traffic, so it's a safe way to walk, scoot, and cycle around the city.

When it's completed, you can get from the CBD, Eagle Street/Riverside precinct, and botanical gardens directly across to the Kangaroo Point Cliffs and Captain Burke Park.

A new tunnel under the Story Bridge will also link up with the [East Brisbane bikeway](/brisbane-city/east-brisbane-bikeway) along Shafston Avenue/Lytton Road for communters in East Brisbane and beyond. It's going to be great.

The bridge will be shaded by solar panels along the entire length, and have integrated vegetation to help keep things cool in the hot subtropical climate. The bridge will have a restaurant over the water, and the public viewing platforms will be a great spot to pause and enjoy the river views or snap some photos.

The bridge has at most a gentle 1:20 grade for even novice cyclists to power up.

## Kangaroo Point bridge construction

{% image "./site/brisbane-city/kangaroo-point-bridge/PXL_20230907_003618396.jpg", "In 2023, a photo of The Kangaroo Point Bridge heads out from the city shore, but doesn't cross the whole river yet", "alignright", "The bridge when it was under construction" "alignright" %}

The bridge is a 460 metre long single-mast [cable-stayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable-stayed_bridge) pedestrian bridge, similar to [the Neville Bonner bridge](/brisbane-city/neville-bonner-bridge/). It's one of the longest cable-stayed pedestrian bridges of its kind in the world. The mast towers 83 metres above the bridge deck.

BESIX Watpac was awarded the contract to design and build the Green Bridge. Construction started in 2021 and will finish later in 2024.

The bridge includes a number of best-practice sustainable features including solar panels on the shade cover to power the bridgeâ€™s lighting, rain gardens at C.T. White Park to slow stormwater run-off, and extensive use of native plants in new landscaping.

## November 2024 status

As of January 2024 the bridge is still under construction but looks visibly complete.

The Kangaroo Point end crosses the existing bikeway at Hamilton Street, and the tunnel at Main Street is open to the public. On the city end the bikeway has reopened at the Botanic Gardens while construction continues.

The bridge is scheduled to open in December.

What about free things to do in Brisbane? The Botanical Gardens, or Kangaroo Point Cliffs are always good for a stroll or a picnic. Captain Burke Park and The Cliffs have free barbecues and picnic shelters.

Alternatively if you're up for a scenic hike or bike, you can do a loop around the City Reach Boardwalk, across the Kangaroo Point Green Bridge (once it's completed), up and over the Story Bridge, then down Ivory Lane to Howard Smith Wharves.
