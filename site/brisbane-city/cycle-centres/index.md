If you're regularly riding to the city but your workplace doesn't have a shower or anywhere to park your bike, you should consider checking out one of the cycle centres.

Brisbane City Council offers Cycle Centres which have secure bicycle parking as well as shower facilities and services such as towel laundering.

Each cycle centre is leased out to a contractor to run, so each have their own pricing and perks. Generally you can subscribe for a yearly or monthly fee, or pay a little more for a single day's use of the facilities. It's convenient for commuters and recreational cyclists alike.

## King George Square

The King George Square cycle centre — Cycle2City — was opened in May 2008 and is taking new memberships.

You can get to the King George Square cycle centre from the Bicentennial Bikeway by getting off at the Turbot Street exit and following the cycleway until Roma Street.

## Royal Brisbane Womens Hospital

The cycle centre at RBWH offers reasonably priced cycling facilities underneath the busway station.

While not ideally located for CBD access, the RBWH cycle centre is open to hospital staff as well as the general public, and offers considerably lower prices than the central city facilities. You could also ride in from the northern bikeway and catch a bus in to the city.
