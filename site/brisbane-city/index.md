Brisbane is a fantastic place to explore by bike. With plenty of bikeways, paths and bike lanes, cycling in Brisbane is the best way to see the sights and get some exercise along the way.

Most of the Brisbane River has flat bike paths from Toowong & West End all the way through to Portside Hamilton, as well as paths through the suburbs and CBD. There's a route for everyone, no matter what your cycling ability or preference.

- The best tourist route would have to be along South Bank, the [Goodwill Bridge](goodwill-bridge), then along the City Reach Boardwalk to Howard Smith Wharves.
- Don't have your own bike? Check out our guide to [bike & scooter hire](bike-hire-in-brisbane) in brisbane and pick yourself up a sweet e-bike.
- Or if you're looking for a challenge, check out the Brisbane [River Loop](river-loop), with a long and short version depending on your skill level.
