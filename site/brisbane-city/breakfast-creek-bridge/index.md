The Breakfast Creek / Yowoggera Bridge is an 80-meter arch span bridge and connects 175 meters between Newsted Park and the cycleway along Kingsford Smith Drive.

It has dedicated pedestrian and cyclist paths away from vehicles, and includes drinking fountains and pause points to admire the parklands and river scenery.

The bridge, which weighs over 300 tonnes, was built offsite and transported via barge to be installed over Breakfast Creek.

The green colours of the green bridge were chosen to represent the leaves of the Moreton Bay fig tree.

## Getting to the Yowoggera Bridge

On the north the bridge connects to the bikeway along Kingsford Smith Drive to Hamilton, as well as Bowen Hills station precinct along Breakfast Creek.

To the south, you can get to the city almost entirely off-road. From Newstead Park there are a handful of back streets and footpath stretches but you can follow the river around to the [Riverwalk](/brisbane-city/riverwalk/) and on to the CBD.

Alternatively, some road cyclists take Arthur Street or Merthyr Road for a more direct but hilly route.

## Traditional Custodians help name the bridge

Council consulted with the Traditional Custodians of Brisbane to name the bridge Yowoggera, which some people believe means “corroboree” (a meeting or gathering). <a href="https://newfarmpark.com.au/breakfast-creek-bridge-a-corroboree-connection/">Evie Drinnan writes</a>:

<blockquote>
  <p>Traditional Owner Shannon Ruska said the mouth of Breakfast Creek was known as Yowoggera; corroborees were held in the gardens of Newstead House, a town was on the other side of Breakfast Creek, and the women’s birthing place was across the river at Bulimba.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, the Mercedes-Benz shop is still a place linked to transport, as it was once a canoe port.</p>
