The Norman Creek bikeway follows Norman Creek from Norman Park to Stones Corner and on to Tarragindi. 

It's one of the older, more circuitous bikeways and is more of a school route than a commuter route. But it's a good trail to explore the creeks and parks in the area, stop off at Stones Corner for a meal, or as a leisurely city loop via the [East Brisbane bikeway](/brisbane-city/east-brisbane-bikeway) and the [V1 veloway](/brisbane-city/southeast-freeway-bikeway/).

The route is popular with joggers and walkers, and is fairly narrow. It's best to go at a slow pace and make sure you have a working bell.

## Getting to the Norman Creek bikeway

The southernmost section of the bikeway connects directly to the [V1 veloway](/brisbane-city/southeast-freeway-bikeway/) alongside the M1 motorway, but the northern sections don't connect to much. 

If you're up for a bit of footpath riding, you can get to it from the V1 at O'Keefe Street.

## Regeneration & rewilding Norman Creek
The Norman Creek 2012-2031 Master Plan aims to rejuvenate the Norman Creek catchment. The project aims to replace the concrete drainage with a more resilient planted ecosystem, expanding bike connections, creating shaded sub-tropical habitats to hang out, and generally make it a nicer place to be.

The first phase has already been planted at Stones Corner where you can enjoy picnic and bbq areas, admire the stream, or play some basketball on the public court.
