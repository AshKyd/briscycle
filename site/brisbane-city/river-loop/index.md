The Brisbane River Loop is popular recreational cycle route that follows the Brisbane River from South Bank to Indooroopilly and back again.

This route is popular on weekends with riders of all stripes heading out to get some fresh air and exercise.

There is a good mix of flat and hill cycling, but you can also choose the Mini Brisbane River Loop if the full loop is too challenging.

The recommended direction for the loop is clockwise. This leaves you with a bit of a climb toward the end, but a very rewarding roll down either Dornoch Terrace or Annerley Road depending on your route.

## The River Loop

The majority of the route is on residential back streets, although there are some more busy stretches further out of the city. If you're less confident with road riding or just want a more leisurely stroll there are enough bike paths you can jump onto, particularly around St Lucia, Taringa, Tennyson and alongside Brisbane Corso.

The full loop is 35-40 km, whereas the mini loop is slightly under 20 km. Jump <a href="#map">bottom of the page for the map</a>.

## Mini Brisbane River Loop

The Mini Brisbane River Loop cuts out the Indooroopilly/Tennyson/Fairfield sections of the loop by heading across the Eleanor Schonell Bridge.

This short-cut effectively cuts the loop in half, and provides a good "training" loop if you're not as experienced or confident.

## Take a different route

The River Loop is pretty loosely defined and everyone has their own take on it. Some popular alternatives include:

- Continue down Gladstone Road rather than turning left onto Dornoch Terrace, to cut straight back to the Goodwill Bridge.
- Take Annerley Road instead of Gladstone Road to get to the Goodwill Bridge without having to climb any more hills
- Take Grey Street instead of the Clem Jones Promenade along the water at South Bank to avoid the busy weekend pedestrian traffic. (Always remember to go slow and give way to pedestrians.)
