The Lytton Road bikeway runs most of the way from Kangaroo Point to Norman Park completely offroad.

## Getting to the East Brisbane Bikeway

As of early 2024 there isn't a direct way to get to the bikeway form the CBD. You must either cross at the Goodwill Bridge and double back to Kangaroo Point, or cross the Story Bridge.

From Kangaroo Point the bikeway begins at the southern end of Deakin Street, following alongside Shafston Avenue and Lytton Road. The Shafston Avenue segment has a pretty steep hill outbound (I couldn't make it up on my single speed bike), so you'll often see people riding the back roads along Lambert Street.

Once you're on the bikeway it's an easy breezy route with plenty of space, and only a few traffic lights.

At the far end of the bikeway you can continue on road or footpath to the eastern suburbs including Hawthorne, Balmoral, Bulimba, Morningside etc.

## Construction status

{% image "./site/brisbane-city/east-brisbane-bikeway/kp-story-bridge-tunnel-complete.jpg", "A tunnel and bikeway connection underneath the Story Bridge", "alignright", "The tunnel connects to the Kangaroo Point Green Bridge" "alignright" %}

When the [Kangaroo Point](/brisbane-city/kangaroo-point-bridge) is finished later in 2024, you will be able to ride straight from the CBD to Norman Park via a tunnel under the Story Bridge.

The bikeway was planned to be built in stages. It currently runs as far east as Canning Bridge at Norman Park before reverting to a narrow footpath. The next phase of the project isn't listed on the Brisbane Council website and isn't likely any time soon.

## Interesting Things Nearby

The bikeway runs right past Mowbray Park which is a a good spot for a bbq. You can also take your bike on the ferry to or from Mowbray Park Terminal to get across the New Farm Park and beyond.

This is mainly a commuter route, but the Shafston Hotel is nearby, as well as a few takeaway food options opposite the park.

At the Norman Park end of the bikeway you can continue along the Norman Creek Bikeway. At the Kangaroo Point end you can check out Captain Burke Park and continue along the Kangaroo Point bikeway.
