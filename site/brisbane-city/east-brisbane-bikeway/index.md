The Lytton Road bikeway runs most of the way from Kangaroo Point to Norman Park completely offroad.

The bikeway was planned to be built in stages. It currently runs as far east as Canning Bridge at Norman Park before reverting to a narrow footpath. The next phase of the project isn't listed on the Brisbane Council website.
