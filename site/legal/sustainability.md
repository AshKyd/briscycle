- Providers & technologies are chosen based sustainability first.
- Development is done with 100% renewable energy on premise
- JAMStack/Static site generation with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) means this site uses shared server resources and requires almost no cloud compute to maintain. This reduces energy consumption in the short term and results in less ewaste in the long term
- Efforts are made to optimise & make the site faster for you. We aim to conserve bandwidth and reduce the time and energy required to download this site. We also aim to minimise client-side scripting to save your battery.
