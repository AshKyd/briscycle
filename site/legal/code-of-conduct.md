<h2>The Quick Version</h2>
<p>Here at {{site.title}}, we are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We ask that all participants are mindful of their surroundings and of their fellow participants.</p>
<p>Participants violating these rules will be removed from the site.</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of services, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Advertisers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, advertisers should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community with no refund.</p>
<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please <a href="/contact/">notify a {{site.title}} staff member</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you can’t find a staff member, please <a href="/contact/">Report an Issue</a>.</p>
<p>
  We expect all community participants (paid or otherwise) to abide by this Code 
  of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all 
  one-on-one communications pertaining to {{site.title}} business.
