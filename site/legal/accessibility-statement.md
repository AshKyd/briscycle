## Limitations of this site's accessibility

While we've done a lot to ensure this site is accessibility, you may find some limitations:

- We aim to write simply and clearly. Some articles may be harder to read if they are about technical topics.
- Some of our articles contain audio and video from third parties. We aim to add captions, text transcripts and audio description to stories wherever possible.
- While the site has been created to be as accessible as possible, the website has not yet been user-tested with people who have disabilities.
