The shire of Redland City provides a surprisingly comprehensive cycling network for both recreation and commuting.

It's possible to cycle from the top to the bottom with very few instances requiring cycling on the road, and while the Moreton Bay Cycleway is neither completed or well signed, a number of coastal cycleways exist to take you as fas south as Cleveland.

In addition to mainland cycling, Redlands City also has attractive off-shore cycling routes, including a number of tourist facilities on the Bay Islands, as well as North Stradbroke Island. The islands are only accessible by ferry.
