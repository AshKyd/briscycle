The Moreton Bay Cycleway runs through the Boondall Wetlands between the Entertainment Centre and Nudgee Road.

The wetlands ride is definitely a scenic route. If you're looking for a more direct north-south path, Sandgate Road has bicycle lanes from Nundah to Deagon and is much quicker, and the Gateway Motorway has a much more direct bikeway parallel.

The wetlands ride is narrow compared to the rest of the MBC, and has a number of chicanes and small bridges to navigate. It's a fun ride, but don't expect to go racing.

The wetlands leg of the MBC is a mixture of bitumen, concrete, and boardwalk.

Some areas are subject to flooding after heavy rains. It's best to leave a day or two after rain before visiting otherwise you may find yourself cycling a lot of the way in water.

The northern end of the Cycleway continues to Boondall Railway Station and the Brisbane Entertainment Centre.

<h3>What to do at Boondall Wetlands</h3>
There's car parking available at Boondall Wetlands from 6 AM to 7 PM, so it serves as a good starting point to a day trip (north or south) on the <a href="../moreton-bay-cycleway/">Moreton Bay Cycleway</a>.

There's cycle parking facilities as well as a <a href="http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/BCC:BASE::pc=PC_2786">wildlife centre</a>, picnic area and a walking trail, although you may want to bring insect repellant if you're planning to stop, because the mosquitos can be a nuisance.

The Boondall Entertainment Centre to the west is also open to the public during the day, and there's short walking trails, a bike track, as well as picnic areas with electric barbecues.
