Bribie Island is a large sand island about twenty kilometres east of Caboolture, and is connected to the mainland via a vehicle and pedestrian bridge.

Bribie Island serves as the northern-most endpoint for the <a href="../moreton-bay-cycleway/">Moreton Bay Cycleway</a>, but very few bicycle facilities have yet been constructed between the island and Deception Bay so it's not advised to cycle this route unless you're a confident road cyclist.

## Bikes on Bribie Island

Bribie Island itself is a great cycle destination for the novice and expert alike. There's an extensive cycle network along the eastern side of the island, a comprehensive residential cycle network on the mainland between Sandstone Point and Ningi, and a cycle track most of the way between the bridge to the mainland and the suburb of Woorim on the eastern side of the island.

There are also <em>bicycle hire</em> facilities available from the plaza area to the south of the bridge at Bongaree.

## Cycle Destinations on Bribie Island

There's two main cycle destinations on Bribie Island; <em>Bongaree</em>, and <em>Woorim.</em>

Bongaree is on the western side of the island, about three kilometres south from the bridge. There main attraction is the park and dining culture. There's everything from take-away fish &amp; chips to cafes, to pub meals. It's a great place to have lunch and unwind after a ride.

Woorim has the surf beach, and as such has more of a beach culture. There's a pub and a few take-away stores, but the main attraction is the water which is a great day trip destination.

## Bribie Island Bridge

The bridge to Bribie Island is the only let-down, as it was originally built in 1963 and is in desperate need of an upgrade.

The cycleway on either end narrows into a footway across the bridge, with bays to allow for passing. There is not enough room to even walk two abreast, and the railing can be a challenge if you get tangled in it.

Bribie Island is a booming suburban area, although replacing the aging bridge is a low priority. It's on the [Queensland Government radar for upgrade](https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/projects/caboolture-bribie-island-road-bribie-island-bridge-planning) and there's a proposal to [keep the heritage bridge as a green bridge](https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/News/Media/Save-Bribie-Bridge-By-Turning-it-Green) much like the [Hornibrook Bridge](../hornibrook-bridge/) to the south.
