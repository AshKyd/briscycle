Bribie Island is a large sand island about twenty kilometres east of Caboolture, and is connected to the mainland via a vehicle and pedestrian bridge.

Bribie Island serves as the northern-most endpoint for the <a href="../moreton-bay-cycleway/">Moreton Bay Cycleway</a>, but very few bicycle facilities have yet been constructed between the island and Deception Bay so it's not advised to cycle this route unless you're a confident road cyclist.

## Bikes on Bribie Island

Bribie Island itself is a great cycle destination for the novice and expert alike.

There's an cycle network along the eastern side of the island, a comprehensive residential cycle network on the mainland between Sandstone Point and Ningi, and a cycle track most of the way between the bridge to the mainland and the beach at Woorim on the eastern side of the island.

There are also bicycle hire facilities available from the plaza area to the south of the bridge at Bongaree.

## What to do on Bribie Island

There's two main cycle destinations on Bribie Island; _Bongaree_ on the west, and _Woorim_ on the east.

Bongaree sits on the bay side of the island and a great spot to eat and explore. There's everything from take-away fish & chips to cafes, to pub meals. It's a great place to have lunch and unwind after a ride.

The beach at Woorim is arguably the main attraction of Bribie Island. It's the closest ocean beach to Brisbane and it's perfect if you're looking for waves and white sand. So bring your swimwear. There's a few shops for snacks on this side of the island, but the main attraction is the surf.

## Bribie Island Attractions

The scenic [Bribie Island Seaside Museum](https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/Galleries-Museums/Locations/Seaside-Museum) overlooks the iconic Pumicestone Passage at Bongaree. It displays collections celebrating the rich and fascinating history of Bribie Island, including stories from First Nations elders. Free entry.

If arts is your thing, check out the [Community Arts Centre & Gallery](https://www.bribieartscentre.com.au/) for wood crafters, visual arts, and the famous gem club. Free entry.

If you're looking for a bikepacking tour there's a number of accommodation and campsites on Bribie Island, though many of the camps require a four-wheel-drive to get to. Check out the Queensland Government's [guide to camping on Bribie](https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/parks/bribie-island/camping).

On your way home, consider stopping by the [Abbey Museum](https://abbeymuseum.com.au/), halfway between Bribie and Caboolture, or time your visit around the [Medieval Festival](https://www.abbeymedievalfestival.com/).

## Bribie Island Bridge

The bridge to Bribie Island is the only let-down, as it was originally built in 1963 and is in desperate need of an upgrade.

The cycleway on either end narrows into a footway across the bridge, with bays to allow for passing. There is not enough room to even walk two abreast, and the railing can be a challenge if you get tangled in it.

Bribie Island is a booming suburban area, although replacing the aging bridge is a low priority. It's on the [Queensland Government radar for upgrade](https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/projects/caboolture-bribie-island-road-bribie-island-bridge-planning) and there's a proposal to [keep the heritage bridge as a green bridge](https://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/News/Media/Save-Bribie-Bridge-By-Turning-it-Green) much like the [Hornibrook Bridge](../hornibrook-bridge/) to the south.
