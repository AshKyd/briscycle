The Moreton Bay Cycleway currently crosses the vast Bramble Bay via the Hornibrook Bridge, between Brighton and Clontarf.

The Hornibrook Bridge is a heritage listed bridge, and was considered the longest in the southern hemisphere when it was opened in 1935. Before it was demolished in 2010 it was considered the longest in the country.

The bridge was closed to vehicle traffic in 1979 when the Houghton Highway opened parallell.

These days the cycleway now runs along the parallel Ted Smout Memorial Bridge which has segregated bicycle and pedestrian lanes. It's a smooth trip across, and especially nice with a tailwind. A purpose-built platform in the middle of the bridge can be used for fishing or a rest stop half-way across.
