The Gateway Bridge (Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge) forms a significant part of the new [Moreton Bay Cycleway](/moreton-bay/).

The eastern bridge has a 4.5 metre wide pedestrian and cycle lane that takes you from Eagle Farm to Murrarie.

The bridge is currently a tollway but you can scoot, ride, or walk across the bridge for free. Only motorists need to pay the toll.

## Opening of the Gateway Bridge

There was an open day for the new bridge on the 16th of May 2010, which gave pedestrians a chance to walk the bridge for the first time.

The bridge was initially open only to motor vehicles, but has since been opened to pedestrians and cyclists alike.

## Getting to the Gateway Bridge

On the north side there is an off-road bikeway spanning that takes you take you most of the way to Nudgee Road with only a little footpath riding.

Kingsford Smith Drive is an industrial zone so there are a lot of trucks. Nevertheless there is green paint on the road so you can cycle on-road all the way to the Portside precinct where you can join up with the off-road cycleway along the remanider of Kingsford Smith Drive.

On the south side of the bridge is a downhill chicane that takes you to Murrarie Recreation Hub where you can enjoy the river, do some fishing, or grab a beer at the pub if that's more your style. You can also get through to Murrarie Station on-road with painted bike lanes.
