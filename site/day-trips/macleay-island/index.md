Macleay Island is a small island off the coast of Redland Bay.

There are no major tourist attractions, although it's a fantastic area to take a day trip and explore. Most of the roads are cycle friendly, and there is an off-road cycleway that runs most of the length of the island, so it's a great place to get around by bike.

There is a rather steep hill to climb to get out of the ferry terminal, but don't let that discourage you, most of the island is flat and quite easy to cycle.

### Facilities

The island is highly cycle friendly, and most destinations have racks or space to lock up your bike. Drinking water is available at parks around the island, but definitely make sure to bring a water bottle.

There's a Spar supermarket near the ferry terminal to pick up essentials, and a couple of shops dotted about the island along High Central Road.

If you're looking for a meal, there are plenty of places to eat about the island. Stop by at the pub near the fery terminal, grab fish & chips on the way north, or enjoy the air conditioning at the Blue Parrot Cafe.

There's a protected beach at the north end of the island at Pats Park where you can take a dip without worrying about bull sharks, as well as

## Getting to Macleay Island

Ferries to the island generally run every half hour from Redland Bay Marina (200m south of the vehicle ferry, see it here on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Redland+Bay+Marina/@-27.6173227,153.3107938,17z)). A return passenger ticket costs just shy of $15.00.

If you're coming from Brisbane, you can ride from Cleveland Train Station. The most direct route is a 13.5 km trek along Cleveland Redland Bay Road, but it's mostly without cycle lanes, and in some places without footpaths.

Redland Bay Council recommends riding the [Moreton Bay Cycleway](/moreton-bay) from the train station, which runs a much longer and more scenic route along the coast. Either way, this much cycling you might want to make it a weekend trip.
