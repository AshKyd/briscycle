Nudgee Beach is a small costal town west of Brisbane, and is a popular cycle destination on weekends. It's not a tourist area and it's a mud beach rather than sand, but the charm lay in the costal atmosphere.

<h3>What to do in Nudgee Beach</h3>
The main attraction to Nudgee Beach is the large park along the water. There's a Fish &amp; Chips shop along the main road, so many people take the trip out simply to have lunch at the seaside.

There's a serene walking trail through the wetlands and a bird hide for watching the wildlife. There's also fishing facilities as well as boat and canoe landing areas. The town offers a few basic cycling facilities including toilets and drinking water, although there's no designated parking so you'll have to find a pole if you wish to lock up.

<h3>Cycling to Nudgee Beach</h3>
There is a concrete cycleway that runs most of the way there. The cycleway does end just at the edge of town, but traffic is sparse and the cycle route follows the quiet residential Chaseley street.

The cycleway branches off from the <a href="../moreton-bay-cycleway/">Moreton Bay Cycleway</a> at Nudgee, between the <a href="../boondall-wetlands-cycleway/">Boondall Wetlands</a> and <a href="../jim-soorley-bikeway/">Jim Soorley Bikeway</a> sections, so you can get the entire way to Nudgee Beach on cycleway from Nudgee, Boondall, Toombul, and even as far as Mitchelton via the <a href="../kedron-brook-cycleway/">Kedron Brook Cycleway</a>.
