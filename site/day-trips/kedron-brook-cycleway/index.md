The <em>Kedron Brook</em> bikeway is a major cycleway that links a number of suburbs from Mitchelton to both Gympie and Sandgate Roads. The cycleway also connects to the <a href="../jim-soorley-bikeway/">Jim Soorley Bikeway</a>, and continues to the northern section of the <a href="../moreton-bay-cycleway/">Moreton Bay Cycleway</a>.

The cycleway runs along the nature corridor stemming from Kedron Brook.

The cycleway consists of mostly concrete paths, although there are a few sections that connect to back roads. Motor vehicle traffic in these sections is extremely rare though, and you'll find it's quite a nice route.

### Making a Day of Kedron Brook

Unless you live nearby, the easiest way to get there is to catch a train to either Toombul or Mitchelton railway stations. The cycleway doesn't run directly past either station, but there's less than 300 metres of road (or footpath) cycling to get there.

The Kedron Brook Cycleway is relatively easy traveling, so expect to make good time. The entire trip from Toombul to Mitchelton probably won't take you more than an hour and a half.

There's plenty of places to stop for water, although as always you're advised to take a bottle of your own. Mercer park is particularly nice to have a picnic in and has plenty of shelters and even some walking trails. Alternatively if you're looking for take-away, you could stop in at either Brookside or Toombul Shopping Centres at either end of the cycleway.
