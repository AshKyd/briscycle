The Brisbane Valley Rail Trail (or BVRT) is a 161 km off-road bike trail following the route of the old Brisbane Valley rail line, It is the longest trail in the country.

Explore some of Queenslandâ€™s most unique country towns with a wide range of heritage-listed buildings, historic remains, galleries and attractions. Whether going solo, in a group or with the family there is something for everyone.

The trail follows the gentle grade of the old rail line through the Brisbane Valley, including through historic tunnels and fording creeks where old bridges couldn't be maintained. During heavy weather some sections of the trail may be closed.

The trail was constructed in stages between 1996, and was finally finished in 2018.
